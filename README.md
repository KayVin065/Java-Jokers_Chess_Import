Welcome to our Chess Game Project! This is a classic chess game programmed in Java including a simple GUI and basic game-specific mechanics.
## Features
	  Game Mechanics:     Player can make basic chess moves.
	  User Input:         Game allows for the user to interact with the game via mouse
	  GUI:                Interface for ease of playing; built with Swing.
	  Move Validation:    Makes sure moves are in accordance with specific piece roles (ex. Bishop, Rook).

## Requirements
To run our Chess game, you'll need access to:
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- IDE or Text Editor

## To Use
To use the application, clone the repository in the IDE of your choice and run the Chess.java file. The GUI will open an interactable window to display the game board and chess pieces
as you play. Use your mouse to click on the piece you want to move, then to the desired location, and the application should respond accordingly. 

## What We Learned
Throughout working on this project, we've gained experience with:

- Java Programming Language: We've elevated our prior understanding of how to use Java, including how to write and handle errors and bugs in our code.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): This was our first time working with GUIs and Swing to create an interactive user interface.
- Version Control with GitHub: We learned about and effectively used GitHub to track and manage our team's progress, including version control and comparing changes in our code. 

These insights have helped us strengthen our technical skills while providing experience for future projects.
