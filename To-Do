// TO DO ITEMS FOR PROJECT:

// edit the movePiece() method in Board.java so that it outputs the updated board only if validMove() is checked and returns true for
// the invoking Piece. outputs "Please enter valid move" if it returns false

// maybe need to check if pieces are captured? this may already be happening in validMove() and I just 
// didn't read through it in-depth. need to set Spot.piece = null if isCaptured == true

// edit the end() method in Chess.java so that it actually works. right now the code runs as an infinite loop

// other than that, I think the code works well and is awesome for our first phase of implementation!
